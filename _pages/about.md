I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. Candidate at Stony Brook University advised by Dr. Owen Rambow. My research interests
are event factuality prediction, cognitive state modelling, and bias detection and mitigation in event factuality systems.
I am also a fellow in the BIAS-NRT fellowship at Stony Brook University which is a NSF traineeship for detecting bias in AI.
Outside of academics, I am an avid weightlifter, runner, and photographer.
