title: "Re-Examining FactBank: Predicting the Author's Presentation of Factuality"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'We present a corrected version of a subset of the FactBank data set. We perform experiments on FactBank using multiple training paradigms, data smoothing techniques, and polarity classifiers. We argue that f-measure is an important alternative evaluation metric for factuality. We provide new state-of-the-art results for four corpora including FactBank. We perform an error analysis on Factbank combined with two similar corpora.'
